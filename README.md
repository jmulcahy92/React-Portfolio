# React Portfolio

This is a single-page professional portfolio put together using React and Bootstrap. It has About, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections. Currently, most of the text and images are placeholders, and the contact form does not send the information anywhere on submission, but the structure is there to enable that behavior eventually. The project cards on the Portfolio section DO link to the GitHub repos and live deployments of their respective projects. The site is fully reactive and uses colors from a Coolors palette. No downloadable resume is linked at this time.
