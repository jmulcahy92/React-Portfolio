# React Portfolio

This is a single-page professional portfolio put together using React and Bootstrap. It has About, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections. Currently, the contact form does not send the information anywhere on submission, but the structure is there to enable that behavior eventually. The project cards on the Portfolio section link to the GitHub repos and live deployments of their respective projects. The site is fully reactive and uses colors from a Coolors palette. Users can download a PDF of my resume via a link in the Resume section.
